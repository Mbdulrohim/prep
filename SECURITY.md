## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@yourproject.com] or create a private security advisory on GitHub.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Security Measures

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- `.env` files are excluded from version control
- Example files (`.env.example`) contain no real credentials

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication for secure user management
- Role-based access control for admin features
- Secure session management

### Data Protection
- Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access
- Payment data is processed securely through third-party providers
- No sensitive payment information is stored locally

### Payment Security
- Webhook signature verification for payment confirmations
- HTTPS-only payment processing
- PCI-compliant payment gateways (Flutterwave, Paystack)

### API Security
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- CORS configuration for proper origin control

### Client-Side Security
- Content Security Policy headers
- XSS protection
- Secure cookie handling

## Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Reviews
- All code changes require review before merging
- Security-focused review for authentication/payment code
- Automated security scanning where possible

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Careful vetting of new dependencies

### Deployment Security
- Environment variable validation
- Secure deployment practices
- Regular security updates

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed. Users are encouraged to:

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Monitor security advisories
- Update to the latest version promptly
