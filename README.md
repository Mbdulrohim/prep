## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Setup
1. Create a new Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Download your config and add to `.env.local`

### Payment Setup
1. **Flutterwave**: Get API keys from dashboard
2. **Paystack**: Get API keys from dashboard
3. Configure webhooks for payment verification

### Admin Access
- First user to register becomes admin
- Or manually set admin role in Firestore

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript checks
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Use platform-specific env vars for production

### Firebase Security
- Firestore rules are configured for proper access control
- Admin functions require authentication
- Real-time listeners have proper user validation

### Payment Security
- All payments use secure HTTPS webhooks
- Payment verification includes signature validation
- Sensitive payment data is never stored client-side
