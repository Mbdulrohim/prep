# CLAPP Backend - Copilot Instructions

This is a comprehensive Node.js TypeScript backend for CLAPP (Health & Wellness Application) with the following architecture and conventions:

Instructions:

# Development Workflow

Development server: Runs via npm run dev, but I keep it running — you DON'T need to start it yourself.

Hot reload: Development server automatically restarts on changes.

Logging: Use structured logging with appropriate levels.

use the best possible way when we writing codes

# Code Editing & Rewriting

When rewriting a file completely, always verify that the result is not empty and preserves essential logic.

Never remove unrelated code during a fix unless explicitly instructed.

When creating new files, confirm they are placed in the correct folder based on the file structure guidelines.

# Package Management

Package manager is pnpm — always use pnpm commands (never npm or yarn).

# Response Format

Before taking any action or writing code, always provide a brief summary of what you understand from my request.

The summary should confirm:

The main task you think I’m asking for.

# Documentation Rules

Never create or commit a new `.md` file after adding a feature unless explicitly instructed
Always add any md file created to gitignore
Never add any test file, not even to test

When generating code, please follow these patterns and maintain consistency with the existing codebase. Always consider the health-focused nature of the application and implement appropriate safety measures for medical content.
